# rethink-migrate
A migration tool for rethink db

## Install

```npm install -g rethink-migrate```

## Setup

Create a ```database.json``` file in the root of your solution with the format:

```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 28015,
  "db": "migrations"
}
```

You can also use environment variables or arguments to override.

## Create migration

```rethink-migrate create [migration name]```

For example: ```rethink-migrate create add-tables```

## Edit migration

Open the file ```./migrations/[timestamp]-[migration name].js```

Add the changes to be made. For example:

```javascript
var r = require('rethinkdb');

exports.up = function (connection) {
  return r.tableCreate('foo').run(connection);
};

exports.down = function (connection) {
  return r.tableDrop('foo').run(connection);
};
```
## Run migrations

```rethink migrate up``` will run all outstanding up migrations.

```rethink migrate down``` will run one down migration.

```rethink migrate down --all``` will run all outstanding down migrations.
